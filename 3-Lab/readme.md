# MIPS32 Programming 

Programs done as part of the Computer Architecture Course.
This repo containg general programs like:

asgn5-count frequency of a character in a string
asgn5-remove Vowels in the string
asgn5-reverse string iteratively
asgn5-reverse string recursively
asgn5-checking the string is Palindrome or not
asgn5-string compare
asgn5-string length recursive method
asgn5-string length
asgn6-factorial
asgn6-fibonacci
asgn6-gcd-recursion-division.s  calculate the gcd using division method
asgn6-gcd-recursion-subtract.s 	calculate the gcd using subtraction method
asgn6-num is the number Palindrome or not
asgn6-num-is the number prime or not
