# MIPS32 Programming 

Programs done as part of the Computer Architecture Course.
This repo containg general programs like:

        asgn5-count frequency of a character in a string  in MIPS
        asgn5-remove Vowels in the string in MIPS       
        asgn5-reverse string iteratively  in MIPS
        asgn5-reverse string recursively in MIPS        
        asgn5-checking the string is Palindrome or not in MIPS     
        asgn5-string compare in MIPS       
        asgn5-string length recursive method in MIPS       
        asgn5-string length in MIPS        
        asgn6-factorial in MIPS        
        asgn6-fibonacci in MIPS        
        asgn6-gcd-recursion-division.s  calculate the gcd using division method in MIPS        
        asgn6-gcd-recursion-subtract.s  calculate the gcd using subtraction method  in MIPS    
        asgn6-num is the number Palindrome or not in MIPS      
        asgn6-num-is the number prime or not  in MIPS
