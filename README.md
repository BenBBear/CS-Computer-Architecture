## MIPS32 Programming

This repository is meant to help someone learn MIPS32 Assembly programming. The example codes get progressively difficult, as more advanced concepts emerge. I wish to make this repository as a reference material for all students taking Computer Architecture Course. In addition to MIPS32 sample assembly code, I have also included a `Project` which was done as part of Computer Architecture Course I did during my undergraduate education.

All codes were tested using the QtSPIM Simulator and in Simple Machine Settings. If you want to have proper knowledge in MIPS Architecture then program in Bare Machine Settings that will help you program the real MIPS processor.

If you do refer any material here you must acknowledge the help and make reference to it. Feel free if you find any bug/flaw.


Enjoy!
