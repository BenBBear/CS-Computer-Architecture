## MIPS Assembly Programming

This repository is meant to help someone learn MIPS Assembly programming. The example codes get progressively difficult, as more advanced concepts emerge. I wish to make this repository as a reference material for all students taking Computer Architecture Course. I have also included a **Project** which was done as part of Computer Architecture Course which I did during my undergraduate education. In this repository there are a lot of MIPS assembly programs which are solution to trivial problems like Sorting algorithms in MIPS (Merge, Quick, Bubble, Selection, Insertion Sort), String manipulation (Reverse a string, find string length etc), fibonacci series, factorial, GCD of a number, etc which anyone generally try when they learn any programming language.


All codes were tested using the QtSPIM Simulator and in Simple Machine Settings. If you want to have proper knowledge in MIPS Architecture then program in Bare Machine Settings that will help you program the real MIPS processor.

Feel free to point out any bug or flaw in the code. If you can shorten/optimise/document/arrange the code, your help will be much appreciated. If you find this repository helpful please make reference to it.


Enjoy!
