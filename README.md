## MIPS32 Programming

This repository is meant to help someone learn MIPS32 Assembly programming. The example codes get progressively difficult, as more advanced concepts emerge. I wish to make this repository as a reference material for all students taking Computer Architecture Course. I have also included a **Project** which was done as part of Computer Architecture Course which I did during my undergraduate education. In this repository there are a lot of MIPS32 assembly programs which are solution to trivial problems like Merge/Insertion Sort algorithms in MIPS, String manipulation, fibonacci series, factorial, GCD of a number, etc which anyone generally try when they learn any programming language.


All codes were tested using the QtSPIM Simulator and in Simple Machine Settings. If you want to have proper knowledge in MIPS Architecture then program in Bare Machine Settings that will help you program the real MIPS processor.

If you do refer any material here you must acknowledge the help and make reference to it. Feel free if you find any bug.


Enjoy!
